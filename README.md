# Dino Mini Game
This repository contains a mini dino game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game features a simple dino character represented using <div> elements, along with a moving barrier that the dino needs to avoid. The dino can jump by clicking on the screen.

## Getting Started
To play the game, open the index.html file in a web browser. The game will start automatically, and you can control the dino by clicking to make it jump.

## Structure
The repository has the following structure:

├── index.html
├── styles.css
├── script.js
└── images/
    └── bg.png
    └── block.png
    └── dino.png
  
index.html: This is the main HTML file that displays the game.
css/: This directory contains the CSS stylesheet (styles.css) used to style the game elements.
js/: This directory holds the JavaScript file (script.js) that implements the game logic.

## Usage
Once you open the game, the dino will start running automatically. To make the dino jump, simply click anywhere on the screen. The goal is to avoid the moving barrier by timing your jumps correctly.

Feel free to explore the code in the styles.css and main.js files to understand how the game is implemented. You can modify the code to customize the game's appearance, behavior, or add new features.
